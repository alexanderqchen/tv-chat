# NEXTIVI

NEXTIVI is a social TV app that allows people who are watching the same channel to chat with one another. NEXTIVI uses ACRCloud API to detect which channel you are watching, then our app places you into the corresponding chatroom. Additionally, NEXTIVI makes ads much more exciting by giving an in-app interactive interface for the ads playing on TV. NEXTIVI also has a store that sells merchandise corresponding to the show you are watching.

This repo contains all the web-view interfaces of the android app.
